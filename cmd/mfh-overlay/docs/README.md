# MFH's General Racing Overlay

This time, let's do this right and start thing off documenting things as they are implemented!

## About the overlay

**TODO**

## Dev guide

This overlay uses a few standard handlers and implement a custom one. Each handler may be accessed on the IP/port (8088, by default) where this service is running, followed by its handle (for example, `http://localhost:8088/res/`).

Each handler is described on [dev-guide](dev-guide.md).
